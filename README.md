# AlphaBox

Open-source implementation of [Letter Boxed](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed) including puzzle generation and solver.

Now that the original game has been placed behind a paywall, I created this fork of [Litter Boxed](https://github.com/louisabraham/litterboxed) and have started adding new features, including..

 - Dark mode support
 - Improved puzzle solving validation
 - Random game generator for infinite play
 - View solutions for any generated puzzle
 - Smooth animations
 - A "par" system similar to what you have in the original game

## Trivia

- Puzzle generation is ensured in the browser.
- Two different lists are used: an easy list so that puzzles have a simple solution and a complete list for input validation.
- Daily puzzles are generated by seeding the random generator with the date.
- Unlike the NYT puzzles, we guarantee that there is always a solution with two words that repeats only the common letter (e.g. LANDS > SECURITY).

## More trivia

- Puzzle generation is done by sampling two words (in `O(1)`) then checking whether the letters can be arranged on a square.
    - It would be OK to enumerate the `12!/(3!^4*4!) = 15 400` possibilities, but to be more efficient, we adapted [Ali Aassaf's Algorithm X](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~aassaf9/python/algorithm_x.html) in JavaScript.

- Puzzle solving is pretty boring:
    - Select words that can be written in the grid
    - For each letter, bruteforce the pairs of words that begin/end with this letter
